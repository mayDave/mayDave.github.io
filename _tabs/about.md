Hi! I'm Davide, newly graduated in Computer Science and eager to learn.  
I'm currently looking for a job in the game industry as a gameplay or tool developer, 
but I'm always open for new and interesting opportunities. 
I love learning new things, growing and pouring my passion into making games.
My degree has allowed me to specialize in software engineering; 
now I am delving into some other topics that interest me, such as engine programming, mathematics and a variety of algorithms.
I enjoy working in group projects with people that share similar passions and interests as me. 
Feel free to get in touch with me for more informations.
