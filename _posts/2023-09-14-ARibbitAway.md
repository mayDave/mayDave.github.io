This was my first game related team project, made for an university exam, it was a good opportunity to improve our overall comunication and teamwork skills. 
A Ribbit Away is a 2D platform, with pixel art graphics and a linear progression. 
There are 3 distinct levels, each one is characterized by new mechanics that get progressively more complex. 
From a design perspective, sound and graphics also change according to the characterâ€™s story progression.
We also had the opportunity to let people try the demo at a local videogame related event;
this allows us to get useful tips on how to make unique ideas more interesting through gameplay mechanics.
