Made for [ItaloCurso](https://itch.io/jam/italocurso-2024) Game Jam hosted by [Siormax](https://www.twitch.tv/siormax):
The theme of this game jam is deeply rooted in the Italian mediaverse from the 80s, 90s and early 00s, fused with horror elements. 
One of the aims of this game jam is also to motivate and shine some light on our local dev scene, 
so easily forgotten in this massive and talented international panorama.

Your work shift starts at 10PM as a security guard at Mediapep studios. 
Your job is solitary, quiet, and monotonous, strange occurrences are rare. 
However, you always need to be vigilant for potential infiltrators (spies or saboteurs) from other networks, 
envious of Mediapep's success. Think of it as Papers Please, but taking place in Italian TV studios in the early 2000s.
